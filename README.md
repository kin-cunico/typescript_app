## Getting Started

This is a typescript project using Next.js.

### use npm run dev or npm run build to start this project in your local machine after cloning this repo

What is the main goal of this project?
I want to create a simple social media that will resemble the old Orkut.

What is the plan?

My plan is to set up a forum where users can discuss and post about any theme.
For this I will be using React.js, Next.js, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.
1st step: create the layout of the page according to my Figma design;
2nd step: create a main forum page, which then will lead to generated paths using Next.js;
3rd step: create user tables;
4th step: create sign up component that will lead to a new "sign up" page;
5th step: create sign up page form;
6th step: create a login component;
7th step: hook sign up to user tables, and lint it with Typescript;
8th step: allow the logged in user to create new pages and posts;
9th step: Finishing touches;

Whenever I make a new update to this project, I will add the description under the steps of each implementation
